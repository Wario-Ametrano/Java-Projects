# Java Projects ☕

A collection of Java applications and experiments demonstrating various skills and concepts in Java development.

This repository contains several standalone Java projects that I’ve built to explore different areas of the language and ecosystem — from core Java fundamentals to Spring Boot applications and practical use cases.
 
## Projects Included 📁

Inside this repository you’ll find the following Java projects:

- AlphaProjectIbernate – A Java project focused on ORM (Hibernate) and database interaction
- ProgettoHome – (aggiungi qui una breve descrizione di cosa fa)
- ProgettoSB – A Spring Boot application demonstrating backend development
- azienda – (aggiungi qui una breve descrizione)
  
## Tech Stack 📦

Projects in this repository use:

- Java – Core language
- Spring Boot – Backend framework (ProgettoSB)
- Hibernate / JPA – ORM for database interaction (AlphaProjectIbernate)
- Build tools: Maven or Gradle (a seconda della configurazione di ciascun progetto)
  
Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language suitable for building everything from small console utilities to large enterprise applications.

## Getting Started 🚀

To explore or run any of the projects:

- Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Wario-Ametrano/Java-Projects.git
```
- Import a project into your IDE

  - Open the folder of the project you want to run (e.g., ProgettoSB)
  - Use your preferred IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code with Java extensions)
  - 
- Build and run

  - If the project uses Maven:
    ```
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
  - If the project uses Gradle:
  ```
  gradle build
  gradle run
  ```
## What You Can Learn 🧠

This repository helps you explore a range of Java development topics:

- Core Java syntax and principles
- Object-oriented programming
- Using Spring Boot for building REST APIs
- Database access using Hibernate / JPA
- Project build and dependency management with Maven/Gradle

Java’s ecosystem offers best practices and powerful tools for building scalable applications. A clear README helps visitors understand those aspects quickly.

## Tips 💡

- Use JavaDoc comments in your code to make it easier for others to understand your classes and methods.
- Add project-specific instructions in each subdirectory’s own README (useful for complex projects).
- Consider adding screenshots, diagrams, or usage examples if needed.
